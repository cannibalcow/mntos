Description
=========================================================================
MNTOS is a BSD licensed program written by Daniel Heldt.
It's main purpouse is to gather data from multiple Tactical overview 
pages on Nagios sites and compile it into a single XML file. 
The XML file can be used by any frontend supporting XML.

Requirements
=========================================================================
PHP4 or higher and the php-xml module. 

Installation
=========================================================================
1) unpack mntos-1.0.tar.gz
   Wherever you want to. 
   tar mntos-1.0.tar.gz

2) edit config.ini
   Add path definitions.

3) edit contacts.ini
   Add contacts as shown in example file.

4) edit networks.ini
   Add your nagios sites. See example in netowks.ini file.

5) add cronjob. 
   If mntos.php is in /var/www/mntos/ and php5 is in /usr/bin/php
   this is how the cronjob should look. This would make mntos run every minute. 

Example:
	* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/mntos/mntos.php /dev/null 2>&1

6) Edit www/index.php line 114
   Change the value equivalent with the cron time. 
   If you have every two minutes checks it should be:
   $refreshfreq = 120; 

Tips
=========================================================================
* Set permissions to the network.ini so that it's not world readable.
* Create a user on nagios system with minimum privileges thath MNTOS uses.
